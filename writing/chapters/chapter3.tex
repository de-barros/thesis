The oppressors maintain their position and evade responsibility for their own actions. There is a constant drain of energy which might be better used in redefining ourselves and devising realistic scenarios for altering the present and constructing the future.

\chapter{Results}
\label{chap:results}

\newthought{Several experiments} were designed to evaluate the performance of the Discrete Voter Model. Two case studies, on elections in Chicago, were chosen to demonstrate DVM's performance on real data. The case studies are discussed in the \hyperref[chap:discussion]{Discussion}, and the experiments' specification and results are below.

\section{Experiment Specification}
\label{sec:exper_spec}

\newthought{The Discrete Voter Model} was evaluated on the $2 \times 2$ case (i.e. $2$ candidates and $2$ demographic groups) and the $3 \times 2$ case that was untenable for previous methods of determining racially polarized voting.

The Discrete Voter Model was run on mock \texttt{Election} objects created with the specifications in Subsections \ref{subsec:two_by_two} and \ref{subsec:three_by_two}, using \texttt{dvm\_evaluator}. All other variables are in Table \ref{table:dvm_vars}.

\begin{table}[ht]
 \centering
 \caption{Non-Election Variables for DVM Experiments}
 \label{table:dvm_vars}
 \begin{tabular}{|l|c|c|}
   \hline
   \multicolumn{1}{|c}{Variable} & \multicolumn{1}{|c|}{option $1$}& \multicolumn{1}{c|}{option $2$} \\
   \hline
   number of MCMC steps, $t$ & $1000$ & $10000$ \\
   granularity of the PHCs, $g$ & $10$ & $100$ \\
   scoring function & \texttt{expec\_votes} & \texttt{prob\_votes} \\
   kernel & Random Walk Metropolis & Hamiltonian Monte Carlo \\
  \hline
 \end{tabular}
\end{table}

Not all combinations of variables proved feasible for the scope of these experiments. Some, like using the Hamiltonian Monte Carlo kernel with the \texttt{prob\_votes} scoring function for $10000$ steps on a set of granularity $100$ PHCs, were infeasible. The combinations that were run are presented in Section \ref{sec:exper_results}.


\subsection{$2 \times 2$}
\label{subsec:two_by_two}

\newthought{For this case}, $6$ mock elections were created for single-precinct districts of size $100$, with $2$ demographic groups, $g_1$ and $g_2$, and two candidates, $a$ and $b$.

Each of the $6$ has one of the $3$ demographic distributions of the district in Table \ref{table:demo_dist}. Each of these distributions is labeled $\{d_i\}_{i=1}^3$ for reference in Section \ref{sec:exper_results}.

Each of the $6$ has one of the $2$ demographic voting probabilities for candidates $a$ and $b$ in Table \ref{table:voting}. Each of these voting patterns is labeled $\{v_i\}_{i=1}^2$ for reference in Section \ref{sec:exper_results}.

The demographic voting probabilities and demographic distributions were combined to create the $6$ unique elections.

These elections were also used to evaluate King's Ecological Inference method, using the \texttt{kei\_evaluator} function.

\subsection{$3 \times 2$}

\section{Experiment Results}
\label{sec:exper_results}

\newthought{The} \texttt{dvm\_evaluator} and \texttt{kei\_evaluator} functions report two metrics: accuracy and runtime. The ``accuracy" of the model on a mock election is the average mean squared error (MSE) between the model's outputted demographic voting probabilities (DVP) and the DVP that generated the election data, stored in the \texttt{Election} objects. The MSE is averaged over all $5$ trials of the experiment. The lower the MSE, the more accurate the model. The ``runtime" of the model is how long, in seconds, the model took to generate its output. The lower the runtime, the faster the model.

Tables \ref{table:rwm_expec_2d} to \ref{table:hmc_3d} summarize the results of running the Discrete Voter Model and King's Ecological Inference method on all of the experiments, for a total of $66$ experiments replicated $5$ times each. Each sample had a burn-in fraction of $0.3$. HMC configurations had a step size adaptation fraction of $0.6$.

A select number of figures, comparing the performance of different experiment configurations on the same election in the $2 \times 2$ and $3 \times 2$ cases, are shown in Subsections \ref{subsec:comp_config_2x2} and \ref{subsec:comp_config_3x2}. Other such figures for all elections can be found in the \hyperref[chap:appendix]{Appendix}.

In each table, $g$ is the granularity of the probability hypercube, and $t$ is the number of steps.

The experiments were conducted in Python 3.7.4 on a 2018 MacBook Pro with a 2.3 GHz Quad-Core Intel Core i5 processor, 16 GB of 2133 MHz LPDDR3 RAM, and a Intel Iris Plus Graphics 655 1536 MB graphics card. All numbers are given with $4$ decimal places of precision.
